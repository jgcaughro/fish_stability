#DSR Relationship

#load data needed: data organized into raster regions, varience in biomass through time for raster region and
#cumulative diversity for raster region

#sum biomass for all collections within each respective raster region for each year
#calculate variance through time for biomass within each raster region
#calculate average species number for each respective raster region

#create new data frame with columns: raster region ID, var in biomass, average species richness, possibly geographic description (ex "Raleigh Bay, SC, GA")
#plot var in biomass as a function of species richness
