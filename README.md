# fish_stability
code for analysis of fish biodiversity and stability

This project serves as an initial analysis for my larger thesis work.

Objectives of my overall work: 

1: Investigate the relationships between species diversity and community biomass and stability dynamics using fishery independent monitoring data.

2: Explore whether stability is due to asynchronous interaction between species and if this mechanism exhibits spatial scale dependence using fishery independent monitoring data.

3: Test theoretical prediction of scale-dependence in diversity-stability relationship using fishery independent monitoring data.

Objectives by the end of the semester: 

1: Clean and initially process data

2: Rasterize data

3: Determine and plot trawl density for data set per raster region


Scripts included in the scripts folder are as follows:

data_processing_Baker
data_processing_Caughron
