Objectives of my overall work: 

1: Investigate the relationships between species diversity and community biomass and stability dynamics using fishery independent monitoring data.

2: Test theoretical prediction of scale-dependence in diversity-stability relationship using fishery independent monitoring data.



Key Scripts included in the scripts folder are as follows:


data_processing
rasterizing_polygons
scaleone_bootstrapsampling
BEF_stats
SpatialScalingDSR


  
data_processing
  Cleanining and preparing raw monitoring data for later analysis. Creating filtered data frames of fish species, flounder species, and shrimp species. 
  
rasterizing_polygons_Caughron
  Oceans raster is created that will be used as base raster for further analysis. Rasters for trawl density, species richness, biomass, stability of biomass, temperature, salinity, and cell identity created.
  
scaleone_bootstrapsampling
  Sampling and calculating algorithm at scale one. Calculates aggregated species richness, biomass, stability, temperature and salinity at the raster level. 
  
BEF_stats
  code for maps, models, and graphs at scale one diversity-productivity and diversity-stability analysis

SpatialScalingDSR
  algorithm for sequentially scaling sampling and bootstrap procedure. Produces species richness, biomass, stability of biomass.
