Notes from boat trips

Event numbers indicate individual tows while collection numbers indicate individual trawls

Two trawls occur simultaneously for each tow

Sampling design : stratified random sampling

Multiple strata within each region

Pool of trawl sites within each strata. Some strata have more trawl sites then others.
Computer generates random ranking of sites within strata before season of sampling begains. Sites are completed in descending preference order and if one or more can not be completed for any reason the site is skipped and the next location on the list is sampled. Some strata only have few location while others have many stations so some stations are sampled every season annually while others may not be sampled every season or even every year.
